You need travel insurance which covers you for:Holiday cancellation due to illness or injury as well as flight delays and cancellations.Snowsports - for strong intermediate and advanced skiers and boarders it is essential that your insurance covers \"off-piste\" areas. Some of Niseko's best \"off piste\" ridings are \"through the gates\". These areas are not in the official boundary of the resort but can be accessed legally from the resort area. Most ski schools require you to have insurance which covers you for skiing in these areas. Costs of rescue and appropriate medical care can be very high.Like most highly seasonal resort hotels and resorts we cannot provide a refund or reschedule your accommodation or services if your flights are cancelled or delayed or if you reschedule or cancel your trip for a medical or other reason beyond your control.Winter weather can delay flights and travel arrangements.
