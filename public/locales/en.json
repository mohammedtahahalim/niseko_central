Most ski schools require you to have insurance which covers you for skiing in these areas. Costs of rescue and appropriate medical care can be very high.Like most highly seasonal resort hotels and resorts we cannot provide a refund or reschedule your accommodation or services if your flights are cancelled or delayed or if you reschedule or cancel your trip for a medical or other reason beyond your control.Winter weather can delay flights and travel arrangements.
